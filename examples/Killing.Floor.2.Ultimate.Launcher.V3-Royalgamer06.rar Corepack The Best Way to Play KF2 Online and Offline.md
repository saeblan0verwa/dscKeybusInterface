The software also had a software development kit (SDK) that allowed developers to create codec plugins (FLT filters) that could extend the functionality of the software and enable it to open and save audio files in different compression formats. Many such plugins were created by the developer community and made available for Cool Edit users. Some of the audio formats and containers that Cool Edit could handle with its built-in codecs or plugins were Fraunhofer MP3, LAME MP3, Dolby AC3, DTS, ACM Waveform, PCM waveform, AIFF, AU, CDA, MPEG-1 Audio, MPEG-2 Audio, AAC, HE-AAC, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, True Audio, WavPack, QuickTime MOV and MP4 (import only), ADPCM, RealMedia, WMA Standard, WMA Professional, WMA Lossless and WMA Multichannel.

Cool Edit was also known for its powerful and versatile audio editing features. It had a multitrack editing mode that allowed users to mix and edit multiple audio tracks simultaneously. It also had a waveform editing mode that allowed users to manipulate individual samples and apply various effects and filters. Cool Edit had a built-in noise reduction feature that could remove unwanted hiss, hum, clicks and pops from recordings. It also had a spectral view mode that could display the frequency spectrum of the audio and allow users to edit specific frequency bands.
  
Another feature that made Cool Edit popular among musicians and producers was its support for MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) files. MIDI files are files that contain instructions for synthesizers and other electronic instruments to play music. Cool Edit could import and export MIDI files and edit them in a piano roll view or a notation view. It could also record MIDI data from external devices and synchronize them with audio tracks. Cool Edit had a built-in software synthesizer that could play back MIDI files using different sound fonts.

Cool Edit was also one of the first audio editing software to support scripting. Scripting is a feature that allows users to automate repetitive or complex tasks by writing code or using a graphical interface. Cool Edit had a scripting language called CEPAL (Cool Edit Pro Application Language) that could control almost every aspect of the software. Users could write their own scripts or use the ones provided by the software or by other users. Scripting could save time and enhance creativity by allowing users to perform tasks such as batch processing, audio analysis, sound design, music composition and more.
  
Cool Edit was also compatible with various hardware devices and software applications. It could work with sound cards, audio interfaces, microphones, speakers, headphones and other audio devices. It could also communicate with other software applications using protocols such as ASIO (Audio Stream Input/Output), VST (Virtual Studio Technology), DirectX and ReWire. These protocols allowed Cool Edit to use external plugins, instruments and effects from other software or to send and receive audio data from other applications.
  
Cool Edit was also user-friendly and customizable. It had a graphical user interface (GUI) that was easy to use and navigate. It had various toolbars, menus, windows and dialogs that could be arranged and resized according to the user's preference. It also had keyboard shortcuts and mouse gestures that could speed up the workflow. Cool Edit also allowed users to create and save their own presets, templates, layouts and themes. Users could also change the appearance and behavior of the software by modifying the configuration files or using third-party skins.
  
Cool Edit was a pioneer and a leader in the field of audio editing software. It was widely used by professionals and amateurs alike for various purposes such as music production, sound design, podcasting, broadcasting, education and more. It was praised for its features, performance, compatibility and usability. It was also supported by a large and active community of users and developers who contributed to its development and improvement. Cool Edit was a software that revolutionized the way people created and manipulated sound.
